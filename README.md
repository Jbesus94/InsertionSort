# InsertionSort
command line program demonstrating the insertion sort

## Description
Sometimes it is difficult to visualize how sorting algorithms work. This program creates a random array of integers with user-defined array length, and color-coded the sorted area on the left to show how the algorithm inserts the next value from the unsorted area on the right into the sorted area.
